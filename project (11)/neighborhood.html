                    <h3>The Sun</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass: 1 Solar Mass</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Sun is a massive ball of plasma and the center of our Solar System, accounting for 99.8% of its total mass. It emits light and heat through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium in its core. The Sun's gravitational pull keeps the planets, asteroids, and comets in their orbits.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass: 3.3 x 10<sup>23</sup> kg</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, is also the smallest in our Solar System. It has no atmosphere, leading to extreme temperature variations between day and night. Covered with craters, Mercury's surface is similar to our Moon and provides valuable insights into the Solar System's early history.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass: 4.87 x 10<sup>24</sup> kg</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Venus is often called Earth's "twin" due to its similar size and composition, but it is vastly different in other aspects. With a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and clouds of sulfuric acid, Venus experiences a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet. Its surface features vast plains, volcanoes, and deformed terrain shaped by intense geological activity.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only known celestial body that supports life. It has a unique atmosphere with oxygen and water that allow for a diverse biosphere. Earth's dynamic system includes active tectonic plates, vast oceans, and a protective magnetic field shielding it from harmful solar radiation.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>MMars, known as the "Red Planet," is famous for its reddish appearance caused by iron oxide on its surface. It features the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and the massive canyon system Valles Marineris. Scientists are actively studying Mars as a potential location for human colonization due to its water ice reserves and relatively mild conditions compared to other planets.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The Asteroid Belt, located between Mars and Jupiter, contains millions of rocky objects of varying sizes. These remnants from the early Solar System provide a glimpse into its formation. The largest objects in the belt, like Ceres, are considered dwarf planets due to their size and shape.</p>

                <div class="celestial-body">

                    </ul>
                    <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, with a mass more than twice that of all other planets combined. It has a thick atmosphere dominated by hydrogen and helium, with colorful bands and the iconic Great Red Spotâ€”a massive storm persisting for centuries. Jupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons, including the Galilean moons, which offer some of the most intriguing environments in the Solar System.</p>

                        <li>Mass: 5.68 x 10<sup>26</sup> kg</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is best known for its dazzling ring system made of ice and rock particles. Like Jupiter, it is a gas giant with a thick atmosphere and numerous moons, including Titan, which has a dense atmosphere and liquid methane lakes. Saturn's unique appearance and composition make it one of the most beautiful and studied planets.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="celestial-body">

                        <li>Mass: 8.68 x 10<sup>25</sup> kg</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Uranus is an ice giant with a bluish-green color caused by methane in its atmosphere. Uniquely, it rotates on its side, likely due to a collision with a massive object early in its history. Its faint ring system and 27 moons add to its distinctiveness in the Solar System.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="celestial-body">

                    <h3>Neptune</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass: 1.02 x 10<sup>26</sup> kg</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Neptune, the farthest planet from the Sun, is a deep blue ice giant with the fastest winds in the Solar System, reaching speeds of over 1,500 miles per hour. It has a dynamic atmosphere with storms and methane clouds. Neptune's moon Triton is one of the coldest objects in the Solar System and has geysers of nitrogen gas erupting from its surface.</p>

                        <li>Mass: 1.31 x 10<sup>22</sup> kg</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Pluto, once classified as the ninth planet, is now recognized as a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt. It has a surface of ice and rock, with vast plains and towering mountains made of water ice. Pluto's largest moon, Charon, is nearly half its size, forming a unique binary system.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The Kuiper Belt is a region beyond Neptune containing icy objects, including Pluto and other dwarf planets.</p>

                    <h3>Oort Cloud</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass: Unknown</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Oort Cloud is a theoretical shell of icy objects surrounding the Solar System, extending far beyond the Kuiper Belt. Believed to be the source of long-period comets, it remains largely unobserved due to its distance. This mysterious region represents the outermost boundary of the Sun's gravitational influence.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Comets are icy bodies that develop glowing comas and long tails when they approach the Sun. They are composed of rock, dust, and frozen gases, which sublimate as they heat up. Comets often originate from the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud and offer valuable information about the early Solar System.</p>
