                <h3>Galaxy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mass: 10<sup>12</sup> Solar Masses</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A galaxy is a massive collection of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity, often containing billions of stars. The nearest large galaxy to Earth, the Andromeda Galaxy, is approximately 2.5 million light-years away. Andromeda and the Milky Way are on a collision course and will merge in about 4.5 billion years to form a new galaxy, often referred to as "Milkomeda."</p>

                <h3>Nebula</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mass: 1-10 Solar Masses</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Nebulae are vast clouds of gas and dust in space, often serving as the birthplace of stars. The Orion Nebula, one of the closest to Earth, is about 1,344 light-years away. The Eagle Nebula's "Pillars of Creation", which you can see above, are massive columns of gas and dust, but they might no longer exist, as the light we're seeing is over 7,000 years old.</p>

                <h3>Black Hole</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mass: 3.5 Solar Masses (minimum)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A black hole is a region in space with gravity so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape its pull. The closest black hole to Earth, Gaia BH1, is located about 1,560 light-years away in the constellation Ophiuchus. Despite their reputation for "sucking in everything," black holes don’t act like cosmic vacuum cleaners—objects must cross their event horizon to be affected.</p>

                <h3>Quasar</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mass: 10<sup>9</sup> Solar Masses (central black hole)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Quasars are extraordinarily luminous objects powered by supermassive black holes in distant galaxies. The nearest quasar, 3C 273, is about 2.4 billion light-years from Earth. Quasars can outshine entire galaxies and are considered the brightest objects in the universe.</p>

                <h3>Dark Matter</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mass: 27% of the universe's mass-energy</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Dark matter is a mysterious and invisible form of matter that exerts gravitational effects but cannot be seen directly. Though pervasive throughout the universe, it doesn’t exist in Earth-like concentrations, remaining an enigma. Dark matter could be composed of hypothetical particles like WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) that have never been observed directly.</p>

                <h3>Neutron Star</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mass: 1.4-2.16 Solar Masses</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A neutron star is the dense, collapsed core of a massive star that went supernova, with a mass greater than the Sun compressed into a sphere about 10 kilometers wide. The nearest known neutron star, RX J1856.5-3754, is about 400 light-years away. A sugar-cube-sized amount of neutron star material would weigh about a billion tons on Earth.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Mass: 10<sup>15</sup> Solar Masses</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A galaxy supercluster is a massive grouping of galaxy clusters, forming some of the largest structures in the universe. The Laniakea Supercluster, which includes the Milky Way, spans about 520 million light-years. Laniakea is Hawaiian for "immense heaven," a fitting name for the massive structure housing our galaxy.</p>

                    <li>Mass: Negligible</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Cosmic voids are enormous, nearly empty regions of space with very few galaxies or matter. The Boötes Void, one of the largest known voids, is about 700 million light-years away and 330 million light-years wide. The Boötes Void is sometimes called the "Great Nothing" because its volume is shockingly sparse compared to typical regions of the universe.</p>
